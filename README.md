## IND

Pre-IND meeting is critical to find answers or clarifications from the FDA about any open issues. You only have *ONE* pre-IND meetings, so use it wisely. IND don't get approved. Once you files you IND, FDA has 30 days to review and determine if the IND can move forward for human clinical trials. It is a passive system and if you hear nothing from the FDA after 30 days, the IND becomes effective and you can start the clinical trial. If the FDA has any concern about the IND, it will put a full/partial clinical hold within 30 days of filling.

What is major parts in original IND
* Toxicology and Pharmocology (PK/PD)
* cGMP/CMC
* Clinical Protocal

IND is a living dynamic document as it will be updated as the clinical trial goes on. Once the original IND is files and approved by FDA, additional clinical and non-clinical information will be added to the orginal IND as addendum. 312.21 define the phase of clinical trials. At the end of Phase 2B, there will be another meeting with FDA over the decision of the Phase 3 clinical trial. This is a pivotal point in the clinical trial as 70-90% of trials entering Phase 3 got approved eventually.
